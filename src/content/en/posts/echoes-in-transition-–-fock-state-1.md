The **sonification method** in *Echoes in Transition* transforms quantum data into an **immersive auditory experience**. The sounds evoke the transition between a **Fock state** and a **Schrödinger cat state**.

Negative values, representing **quantum superpositions**, feature **marimba-like tones** with **rhythmic repetitions**, reflecting quantum fluctuations. For positive values, the sounds take on a **long, string-like** quality, enhanced by **Frequency Modulation** synthesis, offering a contrast to the sharper, rhythmic negative tones. The spatial placement of sounds deepens the experience, creating **movement and transition** as the quantum states evolve. 

This auditory journey provides a **visceral, sonic representation** of quantum phenomena, making the invisible behaviors of particles tangible through sound.

## What function do mitochondria have in our body?

Mitochondria are found inside most eukaryotic cells and have their **own genetic information (DNA)**. Among other functions, they are responsible for producing a form of energy called **ATP**, so that the cell can perform its functions. This energy is realized through a process called **cellular respiration**, where the mitochondria convert the energy from ingested nutrients into a **useful form of energy** for the cells, ATP. 

The number of mitochondria inside each cell varies according to its energy needs, with the muscles, brain and heart being the organs that will have large numbers - there may even be thousands!

Within the respiratory chain, electrons (negatively charged) move through a series of “**complexes**” located in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion, generating a gradient of protons (positively charged), which will be used by **ATP synthase** to generate ATP.

## What happens when the mitochondrial DNA has a mutation?

Mutations in the genetic information (DNA) that exist inside the mitochondrion can have their origin in various causes: stress in the cell, mitochondrial inheritance, mutations in the DNA of the nucleus, aging, etc.,. These mutations **damage**, for example, the “**complexes**” involved in cellular respiration, causing electrons to be unable to reach their destination, or to move to other pathways, such as the generation of **reactive oxygen species (ROS)**, which can cause great damage to the mitochondria.

Thus, mutations in mitochondrial DNA decrease the energy-producing capacity of mitochondria. The first organs to be affected are those with the highest energy demand, causing health problems such as muscle weakness, heart failure or loss of neuronal connections, etc. This situation is called mitochondrial diseases and today they are considered minority diseases.

## What are and which parts of the body are affected by mitochondrial DNA mutations?

* **Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome**: brain (epilepsy, headache, loss of cognitive function, etc.), liver (liver failure), and eyesight (loss of visual acuity and ocular mobility).
* **Leigh syndrome**: brain (movement disorders, lack of balance) and muscles (loss of muscle tone).
* **Pearson syndrome**: brain (speech delay), gastrointestinal tract (vomiting, diarrhea), pancreas (pancreatic insufficiency).
* **Kearns-Sayre syndrome**: vision (affects the retina and can lead to blindness), hearing (hearing loss), and heart (cardiomyopathy, conduction disorder).

### Did you know?

Touch, apart from the other senses, may also be impaired due to mutations in mitochondrial DNA. The nerve connections needed to sense that we are touching an object could be altered, making us unable to feel it!

## Make it at home!

**Objective**. To help participants understand how mitochondrial mutations affect cellular function by using hands-on models to simulate mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and energy production.

**Methodology**. The activity will be divided into two stations: the first for assembling the mtDNA, and the second for constructing the electron transport chain while explaining the consequences of mtDNA mutations.

**Public**: all the public

**Materials**:

* strand of mtDNA: Use beads and thread to make a circular strand of mtDNA. Be sure to get pieces of different colors to represent the mutations.
* Cardstock, ideally in different colors, to represent the different components of the electron transport chain.
* Felt balls
* Markers

**Description of the activity**:

1. Assemble the DNA

Use beads to make a strand of mtDNA. Construct two models, the healthy model (in which all the pieces are identical) and the mutated model (some beads are replaced with different colored beads, symbolizing mutations).

2. Visualization of the energetic effects of mitochondrial disease

mtDNA encodes thirteen proteins involved in cellular energy production and oxidative phosphorylation processes. This is why the electron transport chain (ETC) in mitochondria with mutations in mtDNA is affected.

To simulate this, first cut out the components of the ETC using different colored cardstock:

* four protein complexes (I, II, III, IV)
* ATP synthase
* Small pieces representing protons (H+)
* ATP molecules

On a large piece of cardstock, draw the inner mitochondrial membrane, remembering that it is made up of a phospholipid bilayer.

Place the cut-out pieces on top of the inner mitochondrial membrane you just drew. Follow the next diagram (attached photo)

3. Simulate the dynamics of the ETC:

   1. Place the protons in the mitochondrial matrix, which is the part below the membrane.
   2. Take the electron, represented by the felt ball, and pass it through the four protein complexes (remember that the electron can enter through the first or second complex, depending on the electron donor).
   3. As the electron moves through a complex, protons (H+) are transported from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, crossing the membrane.
   4. Finally, move the protons accumulated in the intermembrane space towards the ATP synthase, where energy will be produced in the form of ATP.

Now, in the mutant DNA model, if a protein that makes up the protein complex is not functional, the electron cannot pass through all the complexes efficiently, reducing the movement of protons and, consequently, ATP production.

## Smell

**The smell** is **subjective**, as it depends on the memory, the emotions and the genetics of each person. It is also a **reflex**, as it can cause automatic responses such as attraction, repulsion, or alert due to certain stimuli. This is why the smell of something can bring nostalgia, make us salivate or even make us alert without any thought!

### Did you know?

**80% of what we perceive as taste is actually smell**. When we eat, **the smells travel from the mouth to the nose**, where they activate olfactory receptors in a process known as **retronasal olfaction**. For this reason, when we have a cold and can't feel smells properly, we can perceive some food as tasteless. **The brain combines the taste and the smell to create a complete sensory experience**. Because of this, certain smells can make us anticipate specific tastes, like the smell of freshly brewed coffee or baked bread, even long before we taste them.

## Let's make a perfume!

| **Top notes**                                                                                                 | **Heart notes**                                                                                                        | **Base notes**                                                                                                                                                                    |

| These notes are **very volatile.** They determine the **initial aroma** of the perfume and make it **fresh.** | They give **character** to the perfume, extend the freshness of the top notes, and are more **warm** and **profound.** | They contain very small volatile components that **adhere** to the aroma, making the fragrance **last longer** and allowing the perfume to stay on the skin for a longer period.  |
| Examples: citrus, aromatic and menthol notes                                                                  | Examples: floral, fruity, and aldehyde notes                                                                           | Examples: vanilla, wood, amber and musk notes                                                                                                                                     |

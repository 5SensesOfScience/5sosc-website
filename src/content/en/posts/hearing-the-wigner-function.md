## What is Sonification?

* **Sonification** is the process of **turning data into sound**. Just like a graph transforms numbers into a **visual representation**, sonification transforms data into **audio**. Scientists use this technique to explore complex phenomena, making patterns **more intuitive** and even revealing details that might be hard to see.
* Think of a **heart monitor in a hospital**—it beeps faster when the heart rate increases and slower when it decreases. This is a simple example of using sound to represent data. In more complex scenarios, such as quantum systems, sonification can reveal unexpected patterns, offering new ways to understand quantum physics **more intuitively**.
* What if you could hear the quantum particles themselves? In this exhibition, you will **experience** how **quantum phenomena** can be transformed into sound.

## What is Quantum Mechanics?

Quantum mechanics is the science of the **very small**—atoms, electrons, and photons. Unlike in everyday life, where objects follow predictable paths, quantum particles behave strangely:

* They can be in **two places at once** (**superposition**).
* They can **affect each other instantly**, even across vast distances (**entanglement**).
* They **don’t have fixed positions**—only **probabilities** of being in certain places.

This weirdness isn’t just a theory—it’s been **tested and confirmed** in countless experiments. But how do we **describe and visualize** such strange behavior?

### Did you know?

**2025** has been declared the **International Year of Quantum Science and Technology** (IYQ) by the **United Nations**, highlighting the importance of quantum science and its transformative **potential for our future**. This exhibition celebrates the cutting-edge exploration of quantum phenomena, including sonification, as part of this global initiative.

## What is the Wigner Function?

The **Wigner function** is a **special tool** used in quantum mechanics to represent a particle’s **position and momentum** (=mass x velocity) at the same time. It’s like a quantum version of a weather map, showing not just where a system is,but also **how it behaves dynamically**.

Unlike classical physics, where objects have well-defined locations and speeds, quantum systems have **wave-like probabilities**. The Wigner function helps scientists **visualize these quantum waves**, even revealing **interference** effects—places where quantum probabilities cancel out or amplify each other.

## What is the Doppler Effect?

* The **Doppler effect** happens when waves change frequency because their source moves **toward or away from us**. You’ve probably noticed this with sound—when an **ambulance** approaches, its siren sounds **higher-pitched**, and as it moves away, the pitch **lowers**.
* The same effect happens with **light**. If a star moves toward us, its light waves get **compressed**, making them appear **bluer** (**blueshift**). If it moves away, the waves **stretch out**, making the light **redder** (**redshift**).

## How Do Planets and Stars Interact?

* Stars and planets are like dance partners in a cosmic ballet. While **planets orbit stars**—like Earth around the Sun—the star itself also **wobbles slightly** due to the gravitational pull of its planets. 
* Each planet and star follows a repeating path, called **periodic motion**. For example, Earth takes 365 days to complete **one orbit** around the Sun. Similarly, planets in other star systems have their own orbits, which **we can predict** by observing their stars’ movements.

## What Happens to the Light from the Star?

As a planet orbits its star, the star wobbles slightly due to the planet’s gravity. This movement affects the star’s light:

* When the **star moves toward us**, its light shifts to blue (**blueshift**).
* When it **moves away**, its light shifts to red (**redshift**).

By studying these color changes, astronomers can learn about the planets orbiting distant stars.

## The Radial Velocity Method

The wobbling of a star due to an orbiting planet (or orbiting planets) creates **periodic changes** in its light. By analyzing these patterns, scientists can determine:

* **How many planets** are orbiting the star.
* Each planet’s **orbital period** (how long it takes to complete one orbit).
* The planet’s size (**mass**).
* Whether the orbit is **circular or elliptical** (its **eccentricity**).

This technique, called the **Radial Velocity Method**, uses the **Doppler effect** to detect planets beyond our solar system.

## So, Why is This Important?

By looking at **how the light from stars shifts**, astronomers can **find exoplanets**—planets that exist outside our solar system. And not just one or two, but sometimes many, all with their own **orbits**, **sizes**, and **distances from their stars**. This method helps us **understand the universe around us**, how planets form, and whether there could be other Earth-like worlds out there, orbiting distant stars, just waiting to be discovered.
